# jsTools
General purpose javascript tools

## What is this?
This should be an expanding set of tools for different areas
mainly super basic stuff I make for bigger project or simply
to practice concepts.

## Can I use this?
Of course you can, however I would recommend you to search for
better options as this might have some dissadvantages/bugs.
Would you find any bug, I'd be glad to hear about it.
